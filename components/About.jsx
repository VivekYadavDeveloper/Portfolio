            <p className='max-w-2xl mx-auto font-Ovo'>After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I decided to pursue my passion for mobile development. I&apos;ve started my learning journey with Java and gradually picked up React & Flutter. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of creating products which solves a real world problem. My core stack is Flutter, Jetpack Compose, and Next.js,. I am also familiar with MongoDB, Supabase and Firebase. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently working as a Flutter Developer at Create.
                When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy playing watching movies, and playing pc games. I also enjoy learning new things.</p>
